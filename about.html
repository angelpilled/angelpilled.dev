		<h2>Short Welcome</h2>
		<p>Hello boyos! Welcome to angelpilled's about page! I want to share a bit of an info about myself, hopefully you'll find this reading interesting.</p>        

		<h2>The Name "angelpilled"</h2>
		<p>My name, "angelpilled" means more than just a string of characters to me. It resonates with a connection of otherworldly beings, entities that are beyond us humans.
		I picked this name in the beginning on 2022, but made my presence online in May 2023 with this alias. This is my attempt to express that mythical feeling.</p>

		<h2>My Website</h2>
		<p>This website isn't only a place for me to show you my hobbies, it's my way of expressing any feelings or thoughts that I have.</p>        
		<p>I started hosting this website circa May, 2023, when I wanted to try something new. I've never hosted a website before, but have developed personal pages prior for a few years.</p>
		<p>Needless to say, I was amazed at what I could do. I've always made shitty ass portfolio websites that even I didn't like, but I got to a point where I gathered a lot of inspiration from neocities websites.
		<p>Because I had a lot of free time on my hand, I could easily spend 7-8 hours a day just to research web development, and add something new to my website each day. Personally, I'm proud of myself for making this website. It's not perfect, but I like the look of it.</p>
		<p>This went on for a few weeks, maybe 2. Then I stopped altogether because le lack of motivation. I haven't touched any part of my website for 3 months.</p>
		<p>Now, after a long summer in 2023, I can safely say, on August 27th, my web development journey starts again.</p>
		<p>Maybe the change I needed was a new environment. Not in a real-life sense, but software-wise. I completely switched to Arch Linux in the beginning of 2023's summer, after having to deal with Windows' bullshit for months. I finally don't have to dual boot and I don't have to worry about Windows updates erasing my BIOS linux boot entries.</p>

		<h2>Experiences with Linux</h2>
		<p>There's probably a blog on this topic by the time you're reading this, but I'll just write a really short wall of text about this subject.</p>
		<p>I got into the realms of Linux before the summer of 2022. I ran multiple distros on virtual machines because I couldn't risk running any distro natively.</p>
		<p>I started with Ubuntu, had a really negative experience, then tried out a few more distros and now I'm here, running an Arch Linux. My distro hopping finally stopped.</p>
		<p>I might have been 13 years old when I first tried out Linux though. At that time I had a friend who ran Ubuntu on her machine. Weird, I though. She said her father have always used Linux and that's what he installed on her PC.</p>
		<p>Looking back on it now, I wish I would have made an effort trying to understand Linux when I was that young. At that time it seemed really grim, and I wasn't wrong; Ubuntu really isn't my cup of tea (and I wrote this in a light-hearted manner).</p>
		<p>I am now running Arch Linux on all my machines, and it's really comfy now. Having a flexible bloatless and free system is all that matters to me. Installing packages haven't been easier on any other distro that I've tried.</p>

		<h2>That's all...</h2>
		<p>...for now. I'll update this site in case anything major happens.</p>
