## Source code for my website
As of October 31st, 2023, I made the decision to re-make my website. The old one was full of bugs, useless stuff and the code looked horrible (though that website was larger, too).<br>
The idea was to make a minimal, single-page website with React.js, three.js for the background and using SCSS instead of "plain" CSS with little text. I didn't do half the stuff I listed, because of simplicity.<br>
If I were a website made to be in production, then I would have definitely used SCSS and React! Though for a simple, personal project, I didn't find it fitting.
