		<h2>C# with dotnet along with IntelliSense server on Arch (2023/09/28)</h2>

		<p>I managed to get C# with dotnet functional with all the .csproject and other types of files to work with. I've done it in like 10 minutes, wasn't really hard. Found a GitHub link of a C# Language Server (first an outdated, which led me to a cutting-edge equivalent of that same language server).</p>
		<p>Of course, a language server wouldn't start without dotnet libraries installed, so I went ahead and installed all the Core and SDK packages. Ran "dotnet new console" and voila! A new dotnet project was created. Shit was so easy.</p>
