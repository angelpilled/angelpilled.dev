		<h2>Memories of 2013 (2023/09/01)</h2>

		<p>I remember when it was 2013 and I got my first Xbox from my father and mother. We were at a parking lot with my dad, and he opened the trunk of his car. There I glanced upon a Xbox 360 with a bunch of games with it. At first I didn't believe it, so I told my father: "Dad, I would have never thought...". Grand Theft Auto V was one of my most wanted games at that time, and we had a talk with my father the year before it. He wouldn't allow me to play that game because of, obviously, sexual scenes. Keep in mind I was 8 when I got the game though, my dad probably changed his mind. Anyways, those times were nice. I wish I could go back. I would play with my classmate Barnabas a lot in GTA Online. We would always try to steal the jet from the military base and fail miserably. We talked on Viber all the time while gaming.</p>
		<p>I really love this song.</p>
