		<h2>Do you ever just think, and... (2023/09/22)</h2>

		<p>I was just ruminating over the fact how social gatherings and social interactions in general are fake. Have you ever thought about? I see, but I don't mean it on a surface level. I know that I can sound like a fucken lunatic in some parts of my blogs, but it seems as if people only PRETEND to be interested in what others have to say so they can just tell whatever the fuck is on their minds afterwards. Just some thoughs, maybe I'm crazy.</p>
