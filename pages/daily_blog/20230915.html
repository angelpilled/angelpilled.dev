		<h2>Oddly Familiar and Strange Room (2023/09/15)</h2>
		<p>Next to the route where I walk my dog, there's a really old building that might have been built 60-70 years ago. It haven't been repainted in decades, and it looks really run down, but people still live in it. It has these kinds of basement windows, ones that are at the height of your feet. Last week, when I was walking my dog there, I looked inside one of the basement windows with lights coming out of it. It was a tiny room with a bed in the corner and some furniture. Though I had a really strange feeling about that room. It looked like as if it was a control room or some shit. Though that's not the only weird thing, the whole street gives off really uncanny feeling. Like I start losing my sense of reality when I'm walking there. Maybe I've gone insane or some shit, I don't know.</p>
