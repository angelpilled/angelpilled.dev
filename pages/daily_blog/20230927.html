		<h2>I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone (2023/09/27)</h2>

		<p>I'm really not trying to prove anything to anyone, not trying to fit in, I don't give a rat's fuck about what other people think of me. I'll dress the way I dress and how people will perceive me is how they'll perceive me.</p>
		<p>A few of my family members always tell me shit like, "prove them wrong!". No. I don't have anything to prove to anyone. I know what I am and I know that I'm gifted with spiritual powers and skills that are beyond most of those fuckers' comprehensions.</p>
