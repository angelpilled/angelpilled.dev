		<h2>Possibilities decreasing, regrets mounting (2023/09/16)</h2>
		<p>I really don't want to sound insane but the more and more time I spend around people the more dissociated I get. When I was at home in the summer, alone with my thoughts, it was like really lonely, but at the same time these dissociation episodes occured in a lot fewer instances. Now that I'm forced to socialize, it was good at the beginning, but right now, after a few weeks have passed, I am now having the realization of why I secluded myself in the first place on the summer. I, of course, couldn't have forgotten about human nature, but after some time, I got to realize yet again how cruel people can really be towards certain, weaker individuals.</p>
