		<h2>Imposter Syndrome (2023/09/21)</h2>

		<p>Ninety percent of shit people say I can not relate to. This is something that I've had problems for years now. It seems as if their hobbies don't consist of anything other than smoking, smoking weed, vidya games, "listening to music". What the fuck does that even mean? Talking about their girlfriends, boyfriends, all the shit I can't relate to. I was hoping I could find someone to talk about low-level shit like C but it seems as if that one person that I've found who could have been willing to discuss those topics with me, is a big fucken moron. His fucken ego flies high up in the air and he thinks he rules the whole fucken world. You're not shit, you fucken moron.</p>
